# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Reports

This directory contains auto-generated RCA reports created by the AI agent after investigating and resolving incidents.

## Format

Each RCA report should follow this structure:

- **Incident ID**: Unique identifier
- **Date/Time**: When the incident occurred
- **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Duration**: Time to detect and resolve (MTTR)
- **Root Cause**: Technical explanation of what went wrong
- **Impact**: What was affected
- **Resolution**: How it was fixed
- **Prevention**: Steps to prevent recurrence

## Example Files

After incident resolution, you'll find files like:
- `incident-2025-01-15-welcome10-bug.md`
- `incident-2025-01-20-database-timeout.md`

These are generated automatically by the AI agent as part of the incident response workflow.
